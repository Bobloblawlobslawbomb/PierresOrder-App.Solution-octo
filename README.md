## Description 
The program will present the user with a set of currency choices, under the heading: 'Pick a currency to convert to:' once the user makes that choice they are presented with a text field to enter a dollar amount. The user is expected to enter the amount of money they would like to convert in dollars (ex. 100 = 100 USD). Then the user is presented with their value of dollars converted into the latest values of the equvivalent currency. 

## Installation Requirements/Setup

### Requirements

- [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A command line interface like Terminal or GitBash to run and interact with the console app.

2) Navigate to the 'PierresOrderApp.Solution/' directory on your computer
3) Open with your favorite text editor (Visual Studio Code, is a pretty sweet one)
4. To run the console app:
   - Navigate to `PierresOrderApp.Solution/PierresOrderApp` in your command line
   - Run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies that are listed in `PierresOrderApp.csproj`
   - Run the command `dotnet build` to build the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries
